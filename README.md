# passwordinator
This repository ("passwordinator") is where I (Joe Bailey) developed my first application using JavaScript for the University of Richmond boot camp that I am currently enrolled in. The goal for this homework was to become more familiar with JavaScript by demonstrating the ability to create a password generator. This generator had multiple qualifications from the client that needed to be met to show true mastery. 

Installation

We live in an age where we need multiple passwords of varying strengths. To protect our most private information. This application will try to satisy the need for a generator which can be used to create a variety of passwords. 

Credits

I was the main creator of the main application and repository. For help when facing obstacles I leaned on my friend Blake, and my friend Chris. Blake is a programmer with 7+ years in the business, and Chris is a work friend who is a fantastic problem solver. I also used YouTube to find different videos on JavaScript, password generators, and various troubleshooting tips. 

Functionality

The password generator uses a variety of checkboxes and a slider mechanism to allow the user to create a password of their choosing. That choic can be a specific choice of characters and numbers or it can be randomly generated by the app itself.
