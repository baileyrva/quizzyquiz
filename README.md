This repository ("quizzyquiz") is where I (Joe Bailey) developed my first game application using JavaScript for the University of Richmond boot camp that I am currently enrolled in. The goal for this homework was to become more familiar with JavaScript by demonstrating the ability to create a quiz game that focused on coding basics. This quiz game had the most indepth directions to date and required multiple different files working cohesively. 

Installation

We live in an age where games and quizzes are a fundamental part of learning. With a shortend attention span it is easier for students and teachers alike to view data of formative quizzes before continuing instruction. This quiz could be used in a coding classroom for professors to double check their students understanding. 

Credits

I was the main creator of the main application and repository. For help when facing obstacles I leaned on my friend Blake, and my friend Chris. Blake is a programmer with 7+ years in the business, and Chris is a work friend who is a fantastic problem solver. I also used YouTube to find different videos on JavaScript, quiz games, and various troubleshooting tips. 

Functionality

The quiz prompts the user with a multiple choice question as a timer counts up. The faster and more accurate the player, the higher the score. Wrong answers are penalized five seconds off of the total time. Best time wins, and users can enter their initials to view themselves on the leaderboard!
